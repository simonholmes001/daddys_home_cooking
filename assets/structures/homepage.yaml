- recipe: "Curry, simplified"
  preparation_time : "20 minutes"
  cooking_time : "min: 60 minutes but can cook for hours - the longer the better"
  difficulty : "3 / 5"
  ingredients :
    - "1 onion"
    - "1 can tomatoes or 6 to 8 fresh tomatoes"
    - "1 small can tomato puree [optional]"
    - "2 green peppers [optional]"
    - "4 to 5 garlic gloves [to taste]"
    - "1 large knob of ginger [optional]"
    - "Patak's curry paste (https://www.pataks.co.uk/)"
    - "Cardonmon seeds [optional]"
    - "Garam masala [optional]"
    - "Coriander [optional]"
    - "Coconut milk [optional]"
    - "Coconut meat [optional]"
    - "Meat, fish or seafood"
    - "Chillies [optional]"
    - "Oil for frying"
    - "Salt"
  method : "Chop the onions, garlic, grate the ginger or chop finely. Combine these ingredients in a bowl. 
  Chop the pepper into large chunks or as wanted.
  Chop the meat into chunks of the desired size, but I prefer a good sized chunk. The recipe here is using leftover meat from a different dish
  and is hence already cooked. If raw meat is being used, cut the raw meat into appropriately sized pieces.
  Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok. When smoking hot, add the onion-garlic-ginger mix and stir. Add a little salt to release the flavours
  of the mix. Stir-fry the mix for approx 10 minutes or until the onions start to melt & change colour.
  Once ready, push the onion mix to the sides of the pan. If using, add in the concentrated tomato puree paste to the pan. Stir fry for some
  seconds and then incorporate the tomato paste into the onions. Once incorporated, add the tomatoes, move to a low heat & simmer gently.
  In a new pan, heat some oil until smoking. Add the green peppers & stir-fry until the skin of the peppers starts to blister. Add to the 
  onion-tomato mix.
  If necessary, transfer the mix to a large pan.
  If using raw meat, fry the meat in hot oil, add salt, and continue until the meat is lightly browned. Add to the onion-tomato mix.
  If using cooked meat, add directly to the onion-tomato mix.
  Cover with the coconut milk and paste or if not using, cover with milk. Add the chillies whole.
  Bring to near the boil, cover & reduce the ehat to a very gentle simmer. Let simmer for one hour minimum, but the longer the better.
  Midway through cooking time, add some cardomon seeds. Just before serving, finely chop the coriander & add to the pot. Sprinkle with a 
  little garam masala. Serve hot with rice & Indian-style flat bread & #enjoy"
